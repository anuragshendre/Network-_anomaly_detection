# Network_anomaly_detection
Anomaly detection
Summary
Purpose: The Jupyter Notebook titled Network_Anomaly_Detection.ipynb focuses on detecting network anomalies using machine learning techniques.

Content: It includes steps for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using various algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.

Key Observations:

Data Quality: The dataset contains 43 features and 125,973 rows. Missing values were only found in the Num_outbound_cmds column, which showed zero variance and was not useful for modeling.

Distribution of Key Features: Features such as Src_bytes, Dst_bytes, Duration, Count, and Srv_count exhibit right-skewed distributions. Most connections are short, with a few long-duration outliers.

Categorical Features: Features like protocoltype, service, and flag include several unique values. The chi-square tests indicate strong associations between these categorical features and attack presence.

Model Performance:

Random Forest: The model achieved low accuracy (around 46%), indicating overfitting or underfitting, and possible need for feature engineering.

XGBoost: The ROC-AUC score was 0.51, indicating moderate predictive power but inconsistencies across classes.

LOF and IF Models: Both models showed high overall accuracy (~90%), but struggled with outlier detection due to high false negatives.

Insights
Data Distribution and Outliers:

Right-Skewed Distributions: Key features have right-skewed distributions with many outliers.

Log Transformation: Successfully normalized features but extreme values still exist.

Feature Importance:

High Correlation: Strongly correlated pairs such as srvcount and count may indicate redundancy.

Categorical Significance: Features like protocoltype, service, and flag show strong correlations with attack presence, indicating their importance for anomaly detection.

Model Performance:

Class Imbalance: Several attack types are underrepresented, affecting model performance.

Detection Challenges: Models struggle to accurately detect outliers, as seen in low precision and recall for the minority class.

Recommendations
Data Preprocessing:

Handle Outliers: Consider applying more robust outlier detection or handling techniques.

Scale Features: Use normalization or scaling to ensure features are on a similar scale, improving model performance.

Feature Engineering:

Reduce Redundancy: Select or engineer features to reduce redundancy among highly correlated pairs.

Utilize Categorical Features: Leverage categorical features with strong chi-square associations in the modeling process.

Model Improvement:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters using techniques like grid search or random search.

Address Imbalance: Apply resampling techniques to balance class distribution and focus on metrics like precision and recall for minority classes.

Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation to ensure model robustness and generalizability.

Alternative Algorithms: Experiment with different algorithms or ensembles to improve predictive accuracy and sensitivity to outliers.

Advanced Techniques:

Real-Time Detection: Consider integrating the model into a real-time monitoring system for continuous anomaly detection.

Ensemble Methods: Combine multiple models to leverage their strengths and improve overall performance.
